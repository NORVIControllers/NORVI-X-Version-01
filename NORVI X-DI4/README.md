# NORVI X-DI4
**Industrial 4-Channel Digital Input Expansion Module**

NORVI is always about connectivity and expandability, and the **NORVI X-DI4** is designed to make full use of the Expansion port on NORVI Controllers. This module features **Direct GPIO mapping**, connecting the inputs directly to the host CPU’s hardware pins for maximum performance.The X-DI4 provides four optically isolated and protected **24 V DC digital inputs.**

By providing a direct path to the processor, the X-DI4 eliminates latency and overhead. This architecture makes the module perfectly suited for high-speed signal capture, including **PWM monitoring, pulse-train counting, and rotary encoder inputs.** It allows developers to utilize hardware interrupts and high-speed timers on the host controller, ensuring that no pulse is missed in time-critical industrial applications.
