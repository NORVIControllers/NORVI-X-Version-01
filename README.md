## Arduino IDE Configuration
To program the ESP32S3 microcontroller using the Arduino IDE, follow these steps:

##Expansion Module Overview
Our expansion modules are designed to scale with your project's complexity. Version 01 features a standard 40-pin interface, ideal for core connectivity and essential I/O tasks. 
For more advanced applications, Version 02 expands this to 50 pins, providing the additional overhead needed for enhanced data throughput and increased peripheral support.
