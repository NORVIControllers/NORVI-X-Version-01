# NORVI X-Q4
4-Channel Transistor Output Module
The NORVI X-Q4 is an industrial expansion module featuring four high-side switching channels designed for 24V DC nominal operation. Each channel utilizes a P-Channel MOSFET to reliably drive high-current loads such as solenoids, relays, and actuators. To safeguard control logic from field-side transients and electrical noise, the module incorporates full optocoupler isolation, providing a robust galvanic barrier between the switching circuitry and the processor.

The module supports high-speed switching frequencies for precise automation tasks and features individual LED diagnostics for real-time status monitoring. Field wiring is streamlined via a 5-pin terminal block providing four transistor outputs (TR1–TR4) and a common Ground (GND).
