# NORVI X-R4
**4-Channel Relay Output Expansion Module**

The NORVI X-R4 is a 4-channel relay output expansion module designed to extend the switching 
capabilities of the NORVI X Modular Controller platform. The X-R4 is engineered for reliable high-power switching with minimal I/O overhead.

By utilizing the PCA9538 I²C I/O expander, the X-R4 allows the host controller to manage four independent relays using only the I²C communication bus. 
This architecture preserves the host CPU's hardware pins for other critical tasks while providing robust, electrically isolated control for AC and DC loads up to 5A at 250V AC.
