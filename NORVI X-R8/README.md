# NORVI X-R8
An 8-Channel Relay Outputs Expansion Module

The **NORVI X-R8** is a professional-grade **8-channel relay output expansion module** designed for seamless integration with industrial controllers. 
It provides electrically isolated relay outputs specifically engineered for high-reliability industrial control, automation, and power switching applications.

By utilizing the **PCA9538 I²C I/O expander**, the X-R8 allows the host MCU to manage 8 independent relays using only the I²C communication bus. 
This architecture ensures minimal I/O usage on the main controller while maintaining robust performance.
